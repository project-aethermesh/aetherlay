# Ã†therlay - RPC Load Balancer

A lightweight, low-latency RPC load balancer written in Go. It is designed to manage and distribute requests to multiple upstream RPC endpoints based on their health status and request counts. The load balancer supports health checks and utilizes Redis for state management.

## Features

- **Round-Robin Load Balancing**: Distributes requests to available endpoints in a round-robin manner, prioritizing those with fewer requests in the last 24 hours.
- **Health Checks**: Regularly checks the health of upstream endpoints and updates their status in Redis.
- **Standalone Health Checker**: Optional standalone health checker service for efficient multi-pod deployments.
- **Static Configuration**: Loads RPC endpoint configurations from a static JSON file.
- **Multi-threaded**: Capable of handling multiple requests concurrently.
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Designed to run in a Kubernetes environment with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) enabled.
- **WebSocket Support**: Full WebSocket proxy support for real-time applications.

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Integrated Health Checks

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/project-aethermesh/aetherlay
   cd aetherlay
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configure Endpoints**:
   Rename the `configs/endpoints-example.json` file to `configs/endpoints.json` and modify it as required in order to add all the RPC endpoints you want to load balance with this tool.

4. **Set up your .env file**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify it as required:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys and configuration. For running a single service with both the health check and load balancer, make sure to set `STANDALONE_HEALTH_CHECKS=false`.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   make run-lb
   ```

### Option 2: Standalone Health Checker

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/project-aethermesh/aetherlay
   cd aetherlay
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configure Endpoints**:
   Rename the `configs/endpoints-example.json` file to `configs/endpoints.json` and modify it as required in order to add all the RPC endpoints you want to load balance with this tool.

4. **Set up your .env file**:
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify it as required:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys and configuration.

5. **Build and run both services in the background**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy to Kubernetes

Basic YAML files are provided for deploying to Kubernetes. It's recommended to check them out and update them as required. After that's done, simply run:
```bash
make k8s-deploy
```

## Usage

The load balancer will listen for incoming requests on predefined endpoints that match the configured chains (e.g., `/mainnet`, `/base`, `/optimism`). It will proxy these requests to the available upstream endpoints based on their health status and request counts.

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint for the load balancer
- `GET /{chain}` - WebSocket upgrade requests for a specific chain
- `POST /{chain}` - HTTP RPC requests for a specific chain

### Query Parameters

- `?archive=true` - Request archive node endpoints only

## Configuration

### Command Line Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | `configs/endpoints.json` | Path to endpoints configuration file |
| `--ephemeral-checks-interval` | `30` | Interval in seconds for ephemeral health checks |
| `--ephemeral-checks-healthy-threshold` | `3` | Amount of consecutive successful responses required to consider endpoint healthy again |
| `--health-check-interval` | `30` | Health check interval in seconds |
| `--log-level` | `info` | Set the log level. Valid options are: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic` |
| `--redis-host` | `localhost` | Redis server hostname |
| `--redis-port` | `6379` | Redis server port |
| `--server-port` | `8080` | Port to use for the load balancer / proxy |
| `--standalone-health-checks` | `true` | Enable standalone health checks |

> **Note:** Command-line flags take precedence over environment variables if both are set.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | - | Example API key for Alchemy RPC endpoints. **Only needed for the example config.** The name must match the variable referenced in your `configs/endpoints.json`, if you need any. |
| `INFURA_API_KEY` | - | Example API key for Infura RPC endpoints. **Only needed for the example config.** The name must match the variable referenced in your `configs/endpoints.json`, if you need any. |
| `EPHEMERAL_CHECKS_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Amount of consecutive successful responses from the endpoint required to consider it as being healthy again |
| `EPHEMERAL_CHECKS_INTERVAL` | `30` | Interval in seconds for ephemeral health checks |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` | `30` | Health check interval in seconds |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Set the log level |
| `REDIS_HOST` | `localhost` | Redis server hostname |
| `REDIS_PORT` | `6379` | Redis server port |
| `REDIS_PASS` | - | Redis server password (optional) |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `8080` | Port to use for the load balancer / proxy |
| `STANDALONE_HEALTH_CHECKS` | `true` | Enable/disable the standalone mode of the health checker |

## Health Check Configuration

### Integrated Health Checks

When `STANDALONE_HEALTH_CHECKS=false`, the load balancer will run integrated health checks using the `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` setting.

You can also disable health checks altogether by setting `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` to `0`, which might affect the performance of the proxy but will prevent the service from wasting your RPC credits by constantly running health checks. In this case, health checks will be run in an ephemeral fashion. For example:
1. A user sends a request.
2. The LB tries to proxy that request to RPC endpoint "A" but fails.
3. 3 things happen at the same time:
   I. The RPC endpoint "A" is marked as unhealthy.
   II. The LB tries to proxy that request to another RPC endpoint.
   III. An ephemeral health checker starts running to monitor RPC endpoint "A" at the interval specified by `EPHEMERAL_CHECKS_INTERVAL` (default: 30s).
4. As soon as RPC endpoint "A" is healthy again, the ephemeral health checker is stopped.

#### Ephemeral Health Checks

- **Trigger**: Only when a request to an endpoint fails and health checks are otherwise disabled. The server marks the endpoint as unhealthy for the specific protocol (HTTP or WS) that failed.
- **Interval**: Controlled by the `EPHEMERAL_CHECKS_INTERVAL` environment variable (in seconds).
- **Behavior**: The health checker service observes the unhealthy status and starts ephemeral checks for the affected protocol. The system will monitor the failed endpoint at the specified interval and automatically start routing traffic to it as soon as it becomes healthy again.

#### Per-Protocol Unhealthy Marking

- When a request to an endpoint fails (HTTP or WebSocket), the server marks that endpoint as unhealthy for the specific protocol that failed (e.g., `HealthyHTTP = false` or `HealthyWS = false` in Redis).
- The health checker service detects this change and starts ephemeral health checks for that protocol only.
- Once the endpoint passes the configured number of consecutive health checks, it is marked healthy again and ephemeral checks stop.

### Standalone Health Checker (Recommended)

For production deployments with multiple load balancer pods, use the standalone health checker:

- **Single Health Checker Instance**: Prevents duplicate health checks
- **Multiple Load Balancer Pods**: Scale independently without health check overhead
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces RPC endpoint usage
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Health monitoring isolated from request handling
